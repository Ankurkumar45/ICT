	<p>The matches were played in the Twenty20 format, and was the first domestic Twenty20 league in India. There was also a planned domestic 50-over tournament, but this did not happen. The ICL lacked the support of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and International Cricket Council, which placed it at a major disadvantage when compared to other cricket competitions.</p>
	<p>
		In 2008 the Board of Control for Cricket in India launched the their own Indian Premier League. ICL was an unsanctioned league. It is dubbed as "rebel league" by Indian media due to its fights with BCCI.
	</p>
	<p>
		BCCI banned those who involved in ICL by the BCCI and other cricket authorities, led to the league's folding in 2009.
	</p>
	<h1 style="border-bottom: 2px solid yellow;">Indian Premier League</h1>
	<p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. It is contested by ten teams based in seven cities and three states of India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh Patel is the incumbent chairman of the IPL. Competition is usually held annually in summer (between March and May) and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, meaning that international cricket does not take place during that the IPL season.</p>
	<p>The IPL is the most popular cricket league in the world, and in 2014 it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[needs update] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy. In December 2022, the league became a decacorn valued at $10.9 billion registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by consulting firm D & P Advisory.</p>
	<p>There have been fifteen seasons of the tournament. The current title holders are the Gujarat Titans, winning the 2022 title in what was their first season.</p>

	<h3>Prize money</h3>
	<p>The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of ₹50 crore (equivalent to ₹53 crore or US$6.6 million in 2020), with the winning team netting ₹20 crore (equivalent to ₹21 crore or US$2.6 million in 2020). The first and second runners up received ₹12.5 crore (US$1.6 million) and ₹8.75 crore (US$1.1 million), respectively, with the fourth placed team also winning ₹8.75 crore (US$1.1 million). The other teams are not awarded any prize money. The IPL rules mandate that half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.</p>
	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>The IPL has some unique rules which the T20I format does not.</p>
	<ul class="ipl_rules">
		<li>Strategic Timeout - IPL games incorporate television timeouts. A penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team is given a 2:30 "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one must be taken by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs. To indicate the strategic timeout, the on-field umpire will raise his hand in the air and tap his wrist. This rule is borrowed from the NBA.</li><br>
		<li>Since the 2018 season, the Decision Review System (DRS) is being used in all IPL matches, allowing each team two chances per innings to review an on-field umpire's decision. From the 2023 season, players can review wides and no-balls, which is not the case in other men's cricket tournaments.</li><br>
		<li>If the bowling team doesn't complete its overs in allocated time, then they must place only 4 fielders outside of the 30-yard circle for the remainder of the innings.</li><br>
		<li>Impact Player (Substitution) - Teams can use a substitute, which is termed as an "Impact player". For this substitution, the teams must handover a list of five players as probable substitutes to the match referee. The substitution can only be made before the start of an inning, when a wickets falls, when a batter retires, or at the end of an over. Teams can declare their playing XI and list of Impact Players after the toss, but all five Impact Players must be Indian. This rule is borrowed from football and the NBA. Both teams can introduce a substitute once per match. If a batsman gets out and the bowling team decides to make a substitution in the middle of the over, the substitute bowler cannot bowl the remaining balls of that over. The replaced player cannot take part in the match, even as a substitute fielder. Teams can introduce a foreign player as a substitute if they have included less than 4 foreign players in their playing XI.</li><br>
		<li>There will be penalty of five runs if a fielder or wicketkeeper makes an unfair movement while the bowler is bowling and before ball reaches the batsman</li><br>
		<li>After the fall of a wicket, the new batsman always will take the strike.</li><br>
		<li>Teams can incorporate maximum 4 foreign players in the playing XI of 11.</li><br>
		<li>Teams must include 25 players in their squad, and they can include only 8 foreign players.</li><br>
	</ul>
